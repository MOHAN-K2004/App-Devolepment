          <h1>Vendor Management System Data Sharing and Disclosure</h1>
          <p>
            In the context of our Vendor Management System (VMS), data sharing
            and disclosure are essential aspects of managing vendor
            relationships and facilitating VMS operations. This policy outlines
            how data may be shared or disclosed within our VMS:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> 1. Authorized Representatives</b>
            <br /> Your and our authorized representatives involved in vendor
            management activities within the VMS may access and share relevant
            vendor information as necessary for the fulfillment of
            vendor-related tasks and responsibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> 2. Technology and Service Partners</b>
            <br /> To support VMS operations, we may engage technology and
            service partners, including telecommunication service providers and
            third-party applications or data storage services. These partners
            perform services for the VMS or connect with the system to enable
            its functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> 3. Social Media Platforms </b>
            <br /> In cases where vendor interactions with our VMS involve
            social media platforms, such as when vendors interact with our
            accounts or link their accounts to the VMS, data may be shared
            within the scope of those interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> 4. Professional Advisors</b>
            <br /> We may engage lawyers, accountants, and professional advisors
            to assist in VMS-related matters, which may involve sharing relevant
            vendor data for legal, financial, or advisory purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> 5. Third-Party Service Providers</b>
            <br /> Third-party service providers, including branding service
            providers, may be employed to enhance VMS functionalities or
            branding within the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> 6. Related Companies </b>
            <br /> Within the VMS ecosystem, data may be shared with our related
            companies as part of vendor management and operational processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            <b> 7. Legal Obligations</b>
            <br /> In certain circumstances, we may be required or permitted to
            share vendor data with law enforcement authorities and government
            agencies as mandated by applicable laws or legal processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> 8. Employer Directives</b>
            <br /> We may share or disclose vendor data to any third party to
            whom your organization, as the employer, directs us to share or
            disclose such information as part of VMS operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> 9. Cross-Border</b>
            <br /> Data Transfer As a VMS provider operating across multiple
            countries and regions, including but not limited to Australia, New
            Zealand, the USA, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the EU, we may
            handle and transfer vendor data to recipients located in these
